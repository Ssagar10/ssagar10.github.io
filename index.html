    <p class="text-example">This paragraph describes about my three favorite superheroes. Born on the planet Krypton, Superman was raised on Earth and uses his abilities to protect humanity from various threats. Spider-Man, or Peter Parker, gained his powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him incredible agility and the ability to stick to walls. Batman, or Bruce Wayne, is a vigilante who uses his vast wealth, intellect, and physical prowess to fight crime in Gotham Cit.</p>
